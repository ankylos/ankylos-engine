To use the ankylos search engine, the crawler runs on top of python3 scrapy.

On linux (debian, ubuntu)

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev libffi-dev
$ pip3 install scrapy
```

After installation, one can use the scrapy command (check installation with `version` command)

```
$ scrapy version
```
